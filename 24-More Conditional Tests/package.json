  "description": "This code snippet explores conditional statements and comparison operators in TypeScript. It demonstrates how to perform tests on variables (strings and numbers), check for string equality (case-sensitive and insensitive), and evaluate numerical comparisons. Additionally, it showcases the use of logical operators (&& - AND, || - OR) to combine conditions and array methods like .includes() to check if an item exists within an array.",
